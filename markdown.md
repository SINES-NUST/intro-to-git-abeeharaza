# Hello, I have completed this course
## What I learned in this course:
* How to open a pull request and merge it
* How to make a new file and format it, then commit changes to it
* How to make my own repository and README file

## What I'm still confused about:
* What's the difference in pulling a request in main and in the forked?
* And which one is better to do?
* How do we secure our main?
